# Ryanair Database Project

Database Project for 2nd year Computer Science. 

I made it using MySQL and IntelliJ IDEA. I connected the two using a JDBC connector.

In the Java program, you run the main program and using the command line you can make find and remove flights which are in the database.

Please note you will need to change JDBC getConnection for it work on your MySQL Workbench
